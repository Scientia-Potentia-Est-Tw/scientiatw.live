## 🏡 Recent status
- 🚎 Commuting between Hsinchu and Taipei: Each one-way trip takes over an hour and a half. After doing it for three days in a row, it’s starting to feel a bit troublesome. But renting places in both cities would be too much financially. I really admire people who commute to work every day.

- 🏃 Exercising daily as much as possible: No matter how things are going each day, I try to drop everything and go for a jog at the gym. Comparing different ways to unwind, I still find that exercise is the most effective stress relief—better than online entertainment.

- 🛏 Sleep: I make sure to get at least 7–8 hours of sleep every night. But my Apple Watch doesn’t have enough battery to track my sleep properly, so I’m still unsure about how much time I spend in REM and non-REM sleep. I’m also trying to rely less on caffeine in the morning.

- ⏳ Work is heating up: I need to wrap up the first phase of my master’s thesis experiments by the end of June, and at the same time, complete and hand over the main objectives of the ITRI project.

## 🌐 Recent online activity

## 🍳 Recent meals and beverages
- 🍱 Lately, I've been switching the main dish at lunchbox places to two or three eggs or a piece of tofu. I realized that in the past, I mostly picked heavily seasoned pork or beef, or deep-fried frozen foods as the main dish. As long as my routine gets even slightly off, my weight increases really quickly. After all, eating out is still the go-to option in Taiwan, so all I can do is adjust what I’m putting into my mouth as much as possible.
