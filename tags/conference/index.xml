      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 PQCrypto conference is being held in Taiwan, and it just so happens that PIs from the Institute of Information Science at Academia Sinica are serving as co-chairs to organize it. Since I have the opportunity, I decided to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This conference is actually the first international conference Iâ€™ve attended in my career; in the past, I had only participated in small-scale domestic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The refreshments during break times were quite exquisite, and the banquet was even held at &amp;lsquo;Eatogether&amp;rsquo; in the Xinyi District (also my first time dining there). Truly worthy of being a conference organized by the IACR. Of course, offering such a level of service means that the registration fee is noticeably different from that of local conferences that I&amp;rsquo;ve attended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
